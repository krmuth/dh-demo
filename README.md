# Intro to the Novel
This Shiny application demonstrates some basic manipulations in text analysis for the proposed module Text Analysis and Visualisation (Level 3 Seminar). 

The dataset comprises five public domain novels from the Level 1 module Intro to the Novel.
-*The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders*
-*Emma* 
-*Jane Eyre: An Autobiographyd*
-*Bleak House*
-*Heart of Darkness*  

The app produces four visualisations. 
-wordcloud (wordcloud2)
-word frequency (ggplot2)
-word correlations (ggoplot2)
-word cluster network (igraph, ggraph)

Data is rendered dynamically with user input.
