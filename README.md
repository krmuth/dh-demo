## Intro to the Novel  

This Shiny application demonstrates some basic manipulations in text analysis for the proposed module Text Analysis and Visualisation (Level 3 Seminar). 

The dataset comprises five public domain novels from the Level 1 module Intro to the Novel

* *The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders*
* *Emma* 
* *Jane Eyre: An Autobiography*
* *Bleak House*
* *Heart of Darkness*  

The app produces four visualisations 

* wordcloud (wordcloud2)
* word frequency (ggplot2)
* word correlations (ggplot2)
* word cluster network (igraph, ggraph)

Data is rendered dynamically from user input.
